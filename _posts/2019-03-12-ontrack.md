## Motivation
### It All Started With Just Birthdays
As an expat with some of my family and friends on the other side of the world, it has always been pretty important for me to keep track of all the special upcoming birthdays. Given the distance, I need to act well advance of the event if I want to send a gift or a greeting card on time. Using a calendar for this purpose did not provide the necessary sense of urgency. So I decided to design an App to keep track of birthdays.

## The Design Process
### Generative User Research
I started the design process by talking to potential users of the app. My initial goal was to understand how people keep track of their important birthdays. Therefore, I started with the following research questions.

1. How people keep track of birthdays, what tools they use?
2. What are the goals of using the above tools?
3. What are the pain points?

## Keeping Track Of Important Annual Events
After talking to potential users I found out that they all had the need to keep track of the important annual days and not just birthdays. As a result I increased the focus of the project from tracking birthdays to tracking annual events.

> The dates users were keen to keep track of had one thing in common. They occurred yearly.

During the generative research phase I also discovered the following.

- Most users remember the dates of key events (birthdays of immediate family) or have a general sense of the part of the year they occur (ex: first week of March)
- Users prefer a quick overview of upcoming events. This helps them reassure specific upcoming dates and make sure they have enough time to prepare for the event
- Calendars do not provide a proper overview of the upcoming events
- Calendars lack the sense of urgency to act on time for an upcoming event

## Interaction Design Process
### Shneidermanâ€™s Mantra
I started the interaction design process keeping the following points in mind.
- An easy to grasp and clear overview
- Provide a sense of urgency
- Quick glance view of upcoming events

> Overview First, Zoom and Filter, Then Details-on-Demand

## Circular vs Linear
### Iteration 01 - Circular Overview
In the first design iteration I used a Circle Chart to provide an overview of the upcoming events. Each slice of the circle represents a month of the year and the area is determined by the number of events in a given month.

Feedback from users showed that using a circle chart provided a summary of the events. However, users found that it did not provide a clear sense of timeline.

Based on the user feedback I revisited the design with a timeline based concept.

### Iteration 02 - Linear Overview
In the second iteration used a Linear Graph to provide an overview of upcoming events. Each section represents a month and the width of a section corresponded to the number of events in that month.

## Reflection & Takeaways
The ambition for this project was exciting but also daunting. Building a completely new hardware device and then software applications that runs on it was a huge challenge. During the process I broke more than 20 flexible OLED screens. However, with the help of my team at the end I was able to create a novel display device and build a game application to showcase its potential.
