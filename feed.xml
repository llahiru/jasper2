&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;project-intro&quot;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Timeline:&lt;/strong&gt; Winter 2018&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Project:&lt;/strong&gt; Research conducted at the Human Media Lab, Queen’s University&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Type:&lt;/strong&gt; Interaction Design, User Experience Design, Prototyping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an expat with some of my family and friends on the other side of the world, it has always been pretty key for me to keep track of all the upcoming important birthdays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keeping-track-of-important-annual-events&quot;&gt;Keeping Track Of Important Annual Events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern smartphones with traditional flat screens offer poor affordances for gestural interactions. The flat form factor prevents a comfortable grip hindering wrist movements. Display area of flat devices can only be viewed from one side, and the visibility reduces when the device is rotated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-challenge&quot;&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How might we create a new display form factor that will offer physical affordances for actions that are quite different from those of a traditional flat form factor of a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-solution&quot;&gt;Our Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cylindrical device with a cylindrical display form factor that allows users to perform natural gestures and to explore the display area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interaction design was done based on how people handle day-to-day objects. The cylindrical form factor provides a comfortable grip when performing gestural interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Success measures of the product revolve around how quickly a user can guess and performs an interaction based on the affordances provided by the cylindrical form factor and the visuals on the display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;research&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bring our product into fruition, we first had to empathize and understand how humans associate with affordances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started by looking for inspirations from Don Norman’s work on affordances &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:Book&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:Book&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We learned that affordances are generated by matching the fit of the body under action to the physical shape of an object. For example, a vertical door handle affords pulling, whereas a horizontal flat bar affords pushing to open &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:Doors&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:Doors&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-wrist-dont-lie&quot;&gt;Your Wrist Don’t Lie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ideation-process&quot;&gt;Ideation Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following our primary research, I then moved onto defining design parameters for gestural input devices. In the design process of MagicWand, I considered the following design parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cylindrical Shape and Ergonomic Tool Fit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optimal Diameter and Length Tradeoff&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conformability of the FOLEDs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conforming with Prior Gestural Game Controller Designs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unconstrained Motion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optimal Design Space for Wrist Gestures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We envisioned MagicWand as an extension of the user’s wrist, supporting the maximum number of degrees of freedom provided by its joints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/images/mw/wristmovements.png&quot; alt=&quot;The wrist is capable of three sets of distinct movements: flexion and extension, radial deviation and ulnar deviation, pronation and supination.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;The wrist is capable of three sets of distinct movements: flexion and extension, radial deviation and ulnar deviation, pronation and supination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We based our initial set of gestures for MagicWand on the above capabilities of the wrist: providing gestures for &lt;strong&gt;rotation&lt;/strong&gt; (pronation/supination), &lt;strong&gt;tilt&lt;/strong&gt; (flexion/extension), as well as &lt;strong&gt;pointing&lt;/strong&gt; (deviation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Motion gesture design was also inspired by everyday object handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motion gesture design was also inspired by everyday object handling. For example, actions such as turning a key to unlock a door, or turning a door knob to open a door, involve rotation through pronation/supination of the wrist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/mw/magicw_sketches.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MagicWand Design Sketches&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When handling cylindrical fluid containers such as bottles, the object is naturally tilted through flexion extension of the wrist to drink from or pour liquid out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pointing with a cylindrical object such as a remote control, laser pointer, or stick involves radial and ulnar deviations of the wrist. Deviations of the wrist becomes a motion gesture when cutting or slashing using tools such as knives and swords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were similarly inspired by the swirl motion used when stirring food with a kitchen utensil such as a spoon, which involves a combination of deviation and flexion/extension actions by the wrist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-physical-product&quot;&gt;The Physical Product&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MagicWand is a cylindrical display device consisting of two 5.5” Flexible Organic Light-Emitting Diode (FOLED) screens wrapped around a 3D printed body. MagicWand features a smartphone running the Android operating system. Gesture recognition allows the use of the wand movements as a form of input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fantasy-game-application&quot;&gt;Fantasy Game Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To highlight some of MagicWand’s capabilities, we developed a first-person fantasy adventure game for aspiring wizards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… — a candle, a wand, a key, a whirlwind, a sword, a magic potion, and a spoon — …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game requires the player to use several tools that fit a cylindrical form factor — a &lt;strong&gt;candle&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;wand&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;key&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;whirlwind&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;sword&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;magic potion&lt;/strong&gt;, and a &lt;strong&gt;spoon&lt;/strong&gt; — to interact with characters that fit a cylindrical form. The game’s goal is to collect all the characters and transport them from the wand display to a virtual magical island on a large external display, through the application of gestures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;image&quot; src=&quot;assets/images/mw/magicwand_gameplay.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A player interacting with MagicWand, (Top) unlocking a dungeon door using a virtual Key, (Bottom) destroying a spider web that obstructs the player’s path with a Sword.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflection--takeaways&quot;&gt;Reflection &amp;amp; Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ambition for this project was exciting but also daunting. Building a completely new hardware device and then software applications that runs on it was a huge challenge. During the process I broke more than 20 flexible OLED screens. However, with the help of my team at the end I was able to create a novel display device and build a game application to showcase its potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MagicWand was designed with specific design goals and under particular technical constraints. Although the empirical findings support the design rationale, many of the details in the experimental results pertain only to the specific hardware implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When designing interactions with MagicWand we primarily relied solely on gesture control. All tasks were triggered only using motion gestures, which can be more difficult to discover than touch interactions. Based on these limitations, future work needs to be conducted to explore the interactions with both touch input and gestures combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you go to edit a post and see special characters and colours intertwined between the words, those are Markdown shortcuts which tell Ghost what to do with the words in your document. The biggest benefit of Markdown is that you can quickly apply formatting as you type, without needing to pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the editor, you'll find a toolbar with basic formatting options to help you get started as easily as possible. You'll also notice that there's a &lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; icon, which contains more advanced shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, though, let's run you through some of the basics. You'll want to make sure you're editing this post in order to see all the Markdown we've used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;formattingtext&quot;&gt;Formatting text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common shortcuts are of course, &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; text, &lt;em&gt;italic&lt;/em&gt; text, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://example.com&quot;&gt;hyperlinks&lt;/a&gt;. These generally make up the bulk of any document. You can type the characters out, but you can also use keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;CMD/Ctrl + B&lt;/code&gt; for Bold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;CMD/Ctrl + I&lt;/code&gt; for Italic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;CMD/Ctrl + K&lt;/code&gt; for a Link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;CMD/Ctrl + H&lt;/code&gt; for a Heading (Press multiple times for h2/h3/h4/etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With just a couple of extra characters here and there, you're well on your way to creating a beautifully formatted story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;insertingimages&quot;&gt;Inserting images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images in Markdown look just the same as links, except they're prefixed with an exclamation mark, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/computer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Computer&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Markdown editors don't make you type this out, though. In Ghost you can click on the image icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the editor, or you can just click and drag an image from your desktop directly into the editor. Both will upload the image for you and generate the appropriate Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Ghost does not currently have automatic image resizing, so it's always a good idea to make sure your images aren't gigantic files &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; uploading them to Ghost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;makinglists&quot;&gt;Making lists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists in HTML are a formatting nightmare, but in Markdown they become an absolute breeze with just a couple of characters and a bit of smart automation. For numbered lists, just write out the numbers. For bullet lists, just use &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crack the eggs over a bowl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whisk them together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make an omellete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember to buy milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feed the cat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Come up with idea for next story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;addingquotes&quot;&gt;Adding quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want to pull out a particularly good except in the middle of a piece, you can use &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You might've seen this formatting before in email clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand the most important points being made&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All themes handles blockquotes slightly differently. Sometimes they'll look better kept shorter, while other times you can quote fairly hefty amounts of text and get away with it. Generally, the safest option is to use blockquotes sparingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;dividingthingsup&quot;&gt;Dividing things up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're writing a piece in parts and you just feel like you need to divide a couple of sections distinctly from each other, a horizontal rule might be just what you need. Dropping &lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt; on a new line will create a sleak divider, anywhere you want it.&lt;/p&gt;

When you go to edit a post and see special characters and colours intertwined between the words, those are Markdown shortcuts which tell Ghost what to do with the words in your document. The biggest benefit of Markdown is that you can quickly apply formatting as you type, without needing to pause. At the bottom of the editor, you'll find a toolbar with basic formatting options to help you get started as easily as possible. You'll also notice that there's a ? icon, which contains more advanced shortcuts. For now, though, let's run you through some of the basics. You'll want to make sure you're editing this post in order to see all the Markdown we've used. Formatting text The most common shortcuts are of course, bold text, italic text, and hyperlinks. These generally make up the bulk of any document. You can type the characters out, but you can also use keyboard shortcuts. CMD/Ctrl + B for Bold CMD/Ctrl + I for Italic CMD/Ctrl + K for a Link CMD/Ctrl + H for a Heading (Press multiple times for h2/h3/h4/etc) With just a couple of extra characters here and there, you're well on your way to creating a beautifully formatted story. Inserting images Images in Markdown look just the same as links, except they're prefixed with an exclamation mark, like this: ![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg) Most Markdown editors don't make you type this out, though. In Ghost you can click on the image icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the editor, or you can just click and drag an image from your desktop directly into the editor.

&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter whether you want to call them categories, tags, boxes, or anything else. You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;basictagging&quot;&gt;Basic tagging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with &lt;code&gt;News&lt;/code&gt; and other posts with &lt;code&gt;Cycling&lt;/code&gt;, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on &lt;code&gt;/tag/news/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/tag/cycling/&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you tag a post with both &lt;code&gt;News&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;Cycling&lt;/code&gt; - then it appears in both sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;theprimarytag&quot;&gt;The primary tag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add a bunch of related tags which are less important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News&lt;/strong&gt;, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme Sports&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, &lt;strong&gt;News&lt;/strong&gt; is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme, but the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their respective archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;privatetags&quot;&gt;Private tags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News&lt;/strong&gt;, Cycling, #video&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of &lt;code&gt;News&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Cycling&lt;/code&gt; - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with &lt;code&gt;#video&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;nohighlight&quot;&gt;{{#post}}
    {{#has tag=&amp;quot;#video&amp;quot;}}
        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...
    {{else}}
        ...regular markup for a post...
    {{/has}}
{{/post}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost comes with a beautiful default theme called Casper, which is designed to be a clean, readable publication layout and can be easily adapted for most purposes. However, Ghost can also be completely themed to suit your needs. Rather than just giving you a few basic settings which act as a poor proxy for code, we just let you write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a huge range of both free and premium pre-built themes which you can get from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://marketplace.ghost.org&quot;&gt;Ghost Theme Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, or you can simply create your own from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://marketplace.ghost.org&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/marketplace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;marketplace&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can write a completely custom Ghost theme, with just some solid knowledge of HTML and CSS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghost themes are written with a templating language called handlebars, which has a bunch of dynamic helpers to insert your data into template files. Like &lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, for example, outputs the name of the current author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn how to write your own Ghost theme is to have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper&quot;&gt;the source code for Casper&lt;/a&gt;, which is heavily commented and should give you a sense of how everything fits together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;default.hbs&lt;/code&gt; is the main template file, all contexts will load inside this file unless specifically told to use a different template.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;post.hbs&lt;/code&gt; is the file used in the context of viewing a post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;index.hbs&lt;/code&gt; is the file used in the context of viewing the home page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and so on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got &lt;a href=&quot;http://themes.ghost.org/docs/about&quot;&gt;full and extensive theme documentation&lt;/a&gt; which outlines every template file, context and helper that you can use.&lt;/p&gt;
